# A-little-game-based-on-Cocos2d-x
This my first game, based on Cocos2d-x, written in C++. 
This game needs player to eliminate blocks. There is a play area which size is 6*6, player will move blocks in different shapes into the area. Once a column or a line is filled up, player will get a score.
Besides, there is a background story as a result of my own hobby, the Red Headed League of Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
